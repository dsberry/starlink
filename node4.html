<h2>Examples</h2>
This section contains some examples of PyAST code. Some of these
operation can be simplified by using the <a href="node5.html">higher-level
functions</a> in the <code>starlink.Atl</code> module, which provide wrappers
for some of the code fragments shown below.
<p>
In general, these examples show the Python equivalent of the
corresponding example in the "How To..." section of the documentation for
the native C version of AST,
<a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htxserver/sun211.htx/sun211.html?xref_">
SUN/211</a>, which should be consulted for further information on each
example.

#  primary HDU (element zero of the list returned by pyfits.open).

<h4>...Write a Modified WCS Calibration to a Dataset</h4>

#  PyFITSAdapter (defined in the Atl module) to provide the sink function
#  that FitsChan uses to write FITS header cards to a PyFITS HDU. Note,
#  doing it this way will mean the FITS file does not inherit the non-WCS
#  keywords from the input FITS file. If this is a problem, then the
#  FitsChan that was used for reading the WCS should also be used for
#  writing the WCS. This will retain non-WCS keywords in the output FITS
#  file.
   fitschan2 = Ast.FitsChan( None, Atl.PyFITSAdapter(hdu_list[ 0 ]) )

#  Ensure the FitsChan will create FITS keywords that use the same WCS
#  encoding that was used by the original FITS file.

#  convert the FrameSet to a set of FITS header cards stored in the FitsChan).

#  If this didn't work (the WCS FrameSet has become too complex to be
#  represented using the original WCS encoding), then use the native AST
#  encoding instead.

      fitschan2.write( wcsinfo2 )

#  The cards are currently stored in the FitsChan. They will be written
#  to the PyFITS HDU when the FitsChan is deleted. But in Python, object
#  deletion can happen at unexpected times, so to be in complete control,
#  we ensure the cards are written out now by invoking the writefits method
#  now.

<h4>...Display a Graphical Coordinate Grid</h4>
<pre class=pycode>

#  annotations are not drawn.

#  We map the entire FITS pixel grid onto this box. So get the bounds
#  of the pixel grid from the FitsChan. If the NAXIS1/2 keywords are
#  not in the FitsChan, use defaults of 500.

   bbox = ( 0.5, 0.5, naxis1 + 0.5, naxis2 + 0.5 )

#  Set the bounds (in matplotlib data coordinates) of the largest rectangle
#  that can be drawn on the matplotlib plotting area that has the same
#  aspect ratio as the FITS array. Shrink the box to leave room for axis
#  annotation.
   fits_aspect_ratio = ( bbox[3] - bbox[1] )/( bbox[2] - bbox[0] )
   grf_aspect_ratio = dy/dx

#  Create a drawing object that knows how to draw primitives (lines,
#  marks and strings) into the matplotlib plotting region.
   grf = Grf.grf_matplotlib( ax )

#  Create the AST Plot, using the above object to draw the primitives. The
#  Plot is based on the FrameSet that describes the WCS read from the FITS
#  headers, so the plot knows how to convert from WCS coords to pixel
#  coords, and then to matplotlib data coords.
   plot = Ast.Plot( wcsinfo, gbox, bbox, grf )

#  And finally, draw the annotated WCS axes and any coordinate grid
#  requested in the plotting attributes.
