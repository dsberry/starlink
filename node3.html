<h2>Notes on individual classes</h2>
This section contains specific notes on individual classes of AST objects.
<p>

<h3 id="s1">Channel</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <i>source</i> and <i>sink</i> functions are specified by
supplying two objects: the source object should be an instance of a class
that provides a method called <code>astsource</code>, and the sink object
should be an instance of a class that provides a method called
<code>astsink</code>. The <code>read()</code> method of the Channel class
calls the <code>astsource</code> method repeatedly with no arguments, and
expects it to return a string holding the next line of text input to store in the Channel.
Likewise,  <code>write()</code> method of the Channel class will call the
<code>astsink</code> method repeatedly with a single argument, the text of
the next line to store in the external data sink, and will ignore anything
returned by <code>astsink</code>.
</ul>

<h3 id="s2">FitsChan</h3>
<ul>

<li>As with the basic Channel class, the <i>source</i> and <i>sink</i>
functions are specified by supplying objects that provides methods called
<code>astsource</code> and <code>astsink</code>. Note, the
<code>starlink.Atl</code> module contains a class,
<code><a href="node5.html#pyfitsadapter">PyFITSAdapter</a></code>,  that
can be used to provide such methods for the specific case where the
external data source is a
<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits">PyFITS</a>
header.<p>

<li>When invoking the <code>read</code> method to read an object from a
<a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htxserver/sun211.htx/node648.html?xref_FitsChan">
FitsChan,</a> the FitsChan's "Card" attribute will be cleared automatically
before the read is performed. This means it is not necessary to clear
"Card" explicitly before calling the <code>read</code> method (as is
required in C and Fortran).<p>

<li>The FitsChan class is an iterable class in Python. So, for instance, if
"fc" is a reference to a FitsChan, you can loop round all cards in the
FitsChan by doing
<p>
<span class=pycode>
>>> for card in fc:<br>
>>> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(card)
</span>
<p>
However, this is achieved by incrementing the <a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htxserver/sun211.htx/node464.html?xref_Card">Card</a>
attribute of the FitsChan. So the looping will be affected by any other operation that changes the
Card attribute of the FitsChan during the loop.

<li> The FitsChan class can be used as a python mapping. So for instance, if
"fc" is a reference to a FitsChan, you can assign a value to the NAXIS1
keyword by doing
<p>
<span class=pycode>
>>> fc["NAXIS1"] = 1200
</span>
<p>
If a card for the keyword already exists in the FitsChan, the value of
the card will be changed. If the FitsChan does not contain a card for the
named keyword, a new card will be appended to the end of the FitsChan.
You can retrieve the value of the a keyword in a similar way: for
instance,
<p>
<span class=pycode>
>>> crval1 = fc["CRVAL1"]
</span>
<p>
Note, if a keyword occurs more than once in a FitsChan, the the retrieved
value will be a tuple containing all the individual keyword values.

<li>If a FitsChan is index using integers, the value returned is the whole
80-column header card at the given zero-based index. When assigning to an
element of a FitsChan indexed by an integer, the assigned value should be
a whole 80-column header card, which will overwrite the existing card at
the given index. If the index is larger than the number of cards in the
FitsChan, the new card will be appended to the end of the FitsChan.

</ul>

<h3 id="s0">Frame</h3>
<ul>
<li>The methods
<a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htxserver/sun211.htx/node274.html?xref_astGetActiveUnit">astGetActiveUnit</a>
and <a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htxserver/sun211.htx/node387.html?xref_astSetActiveUnit">astSetActiveUnit</a>
are not present in PyAST. Instead, each
<a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htxserver/sun211.htx/node651.html?xref_Frame">Frame</a>
has a Python property called "ActiveUnit", which takes boolean values
True or False, and can be set and get just like any other property.
<p>
<span class=pycode>
>>> print( frame.ActiveUnit )<br>
>>> frame.ActiveUnit = True
</span>
<p>
</ul>

<h3 id="s3">KeyMap</h3>
<ul>
<li>Currently, none of the methods available within AST for the
<a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htxserver/sun211.htx/node656.html?xref_KeyMap">KeyMap</a>
class are available in Python. However, KeyMaps can be created in the
usual way, and entries can be written to or read from a KeyMap using the
syntax of a Python mapping. For instance:
<p>
<span class=pycode>
>>> import starlink.Ast as Ast<br>
>>> km = Ast.KeyMap()<br>
>>> km['fred'] = 1.2
</span>
<p>
Note, only strings and integers should be used as keys with a KeyMap. If
a string is used, the returned value is the value of the KeyMap entry
with the specified key. If an integer is used, the returned value is a
tuple containing the key and value of the corresponding entry in the
KeyMap (the order in which entries are returned is specified by the
<a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htxserver/sun211.htx/node597.html?xref_SortBy">
SortBy</a> attribute of the KeyMap). When setting a value, a
<code>starlink.Ast.MPIND</code> exception is reported if the specified zero-based
integer index is greater than or equal to the number of entries in the
KeyMap.

<li>Each KeyMap object is iterable, each item being returned as a (key,value)
tuple.
<p>
<span class=pycode>
>>> for (k,v) in km:<br>
>>> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(k)<br>
>>> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(v)
</span>
<p>
</ul>


<h3 id="s4">Plot</h3>
<ul>

<li>The <a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htxserver/sun211.htx/node666.html?xref_Plot">
Plot</a> class does not draw any graphics itself. Instead, it invokes the
methods of a specified "grf" object to draw lines, text strings, markers,
etc. A reference to such a "grf" object must be supplied when a Plot is
created. PyAST provides the <code>starlink.Grf.grf_matplotlib</code>
class, that uses the facilities of the <a
href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">matplotlib</a> library to plot
the required primitives. So, the following code will create an annotated
coordinate grid covering a square in a simple default 2D Frame:
<p>
<span class=pycode>
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br>
import starlink.Ast as Ast<br>
import starlink.Grf as Grf<br>
<br>
#  Create a matplotlib figure covering the whole work space<br>
fig = plt.figure()<br>
<br>
#  Create a matplotlib "Axes" (i.e. the plotting region) covering the whole<br>
#  Figure. Ensure that the matplotlib axis annotations are not drawn.<br>
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)<br>
ax.xaxis.set_visible(False)<br>
ax.yaxis.set_visible(False)<br>
<br>
#  Create a grf module that knows how to draw into the matplotlib plotting<br>
#  region.<br>
grf = Grf.grf_matplotlib( ax )<br>
<br>
# Store the required bounds of the Plot within the plotting region.<br>
gbox = ( 0.1, 0.1, 0.9, 0.9 )<br>
<br>
# Store the required bounds of the Plot within the simple default Frame.<br>
bbox = ( -1.0, -1.0, 1.0, 1.0 )<br>
<br>
# Create the Plot, using the above grf object, and using a default Frame.<br>
plot = Ast.Plot( None, gbox, bbox, grf )<br>
<br>
#  Draw a coordinate grid.<br>
plot.grid()<br>
<br>
#  Display everything.<br>
plt.show()<br>
</span>
<p>
Other such classes could be written based on other graphics libraries,
following the pattern of the <code>grf_matplotlib</code> class (for more
detailed documentation on the required methods, see also the grf_pgplot.c
file in the AST source distribution).

</ul>

<h3 id="s5">Table</h3>
<ul>
<li>The following AST attributes have no corresponding Python properties
due to the fact that the names are not static. Instead, they attribute
values can be accessed using methods with the same names.

<ul>
<li> ColumnLenC
<li> ColumnLength
<li> ColumnType
<li> ColumnNdim
<li> ColumnUnit
</ul>

For instance, to print the value of the AST attribute
"ColumnLength(BValues)", you should do:
<span class=pycode>
>>> print( table.columnlength( 'BValues' ) )
</span>

</ul>


<h3 id="s6">FitsTable</h3>
<ul>
<li>The astPutColumnData and astGetColumnData methods are not implemented
in PyAST - instead, access the individual cells of the table as entries
within a KeyMap.
</ul>
